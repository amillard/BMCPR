# BMCPR

Welcome to **BMCPR** — a collection of useful scripts and tools developed to support workflows around bacteriophage genomics, analysis, and related bioinformatics tasks.

This repository holds a set of scripts that might be useful to others working in phage research, sequencing, and computational biology. Whether you’re automating parts of your analysis, testing workflows, or integrating with other pipelines, we hope these resources save you time and effort.

## What is BMCPR?

**BMCPR** (Becky Mayer Centre for Phage Research) is part of the research efforts within the phage genomics community at the University of Leicester focusing on bacteriophage biology, genomics, and applied computational methods. The centre is engaged in multidisciplinary research aimed at understanding phage diversity and driving applications such as phage therapy and high-throughput sequencing approaches. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
