# BMCPR

Welcome to Becky Mayer Centre for Phage Research general repo. It contains a collection of useful (possibly) scripts and tools developed to support workflows around bacteriophage genomics, analysis, and related bioinformatics. The scripts here are used general/random scripts that we often use - which are not associated with a specific project/workflow. 

## What is BMCPR?

**BMCPR** (Becky Mayer Centre for Phage Research) is part of the research efforts within the phage genomics community at the University of Leicester focusing on bacteriophage biology, bacteriophage genomics and bacteriophage threapy. The centre is engaged in multidisciplinary research aimed at understanding phage diversity and driving applications such as phage therapy and high-throughput sequencing approaches.
